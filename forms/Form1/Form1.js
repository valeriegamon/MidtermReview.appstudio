/*
There are three sizes of poodles: standard, miniature, and toy. Write a program that asks the user what size their poodle is. The user must use the words: standard, miniature, or toy.  However, they can use whatever case they want
(eg. TOY, Toy, toy, etc). Also, let the user say how many times they want to run the program. You must use a while loop and no more than 2 if/elses. Let the user decide how many times they want to run the program. 
Output the appropriate message in a popup using this format: 
      Toy dogs are so tiny. 
or   
      Miniature dogs are very small but very hardy. 
or
     Standard dogs are really very large.
